# REDCap Migration Best Practices

This guide outlines recommended practices for successful data migrations from legacy systems to REDCap. Following these practices will help ensure data integrity, security, and a smooth migration process.

## Before Migration

### Data Preparation

1. **Clean Source Data First**
   - Resolve missing values and inconsistencies in the source data before migration
   - Standardize formats (dates, names, identifiers) to ensure consistency
   - Remove duplicate records to prevent issues during import

2. **Understand Your Data Dictionary**
   - Thoroughly review the REDCap data dictionary of the destination project
   - Understand field types, validation rules, and required fields
   - Identify any calculated fields or complex branching logic

3. **Map Fields Carefully**
   - Create comprehensive mapping documents that account for all source fields
   - Pay special attention to coded values (dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes)
   - Document any transformations or calculations needed during migration

4. **Identify PHI/PII Data**
   - Clearly mark fields containing Protected Health Information or Personally Identifiable Information
   - Ensure proper security measures are in place for handling sensitive data
   - Consider if any PHI can be de-identified before migration

### Test Environment

1. **Always Test First**
   - Perform initial migrations in a test REDCap project
   - Verify data integrity and accuracy before moving to production
   - Test with a subset of data before full migration

2. **Create Backup Points**
   - Back up source data before any transformation
   - Document the state of the target REDCap project before migration
   - Establish rollback procedures in case issues arise

## During Migration

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use Batch Processing**
   - Migrate data in reasonably sized batches (100-500 records)
   - Monitor system performance and adjust batch size if needed
   - Use appropriate commit points to ensure data consistency

2. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
   - Implement proper error handling and logging
   - Create a process for records that fail to migrate
   - Design for recoverability if migration is interrupted

### Validation

1. **Validate Before and After**
   - Implement pre-migration validation to catch issues early
   - Perform post-migration validation to ensure data integrity
   - Check record counts, field distributions, and summary statistics

2. **Verify Critical Data**
   - Double-check calculation results and derived fields
   - Ensure date formats were correctly converted
   - Verify that coded values (multiple choice fields) were correctly mapped

## After Migration

### Quality Assurance

1. **Statistical Verification**
   - Compare summary statistics between source and destination
   - Check for unexpected null values or outliers in the migrated data
   - Verify record counts match between systems

2. **Sample Record Review**
   - Manually review a random sample of records to verify accuracy
   - Pay special attention to records with complex data or edge cases
   - Have subject matter experts validate critical records

3. **Document the Process**
   - Record any issues encountered and their resolutions
   - Note any data transformations or special handling
   - Document any records excluded from migration and why

### Security Considerations

1. **Clean Up Temporary Files**
   - Securely delete any temporary files containing PHI/PII
   - Remove sensitive data from logs or reports
   - Verify that access to migration files is properly restricted

2. **Audit the Process**
   - Review access logs during the migration period
   - Verify that only authorized personnel had access
   - Document the entire migration for compliance purposes

## Special Considerations for Complex Data

### Longitudinal Data

1. **Preserve Event Mappings**
   - Ensure data is mapped to the correct events in REDCap
   - Verify event designation for each record
   - Maintain the temporal relationship between measurements

2. **Handle Repeating Instruments**
   - Map repeating data to REDCap's repeating instruments structure
   - Maintain instance numbering and relationships
   - Verify that all instances were correctly migrated

### File Attachments

1. **Migrate Files Separately**
   - Handle file attachments as a separate migration step
   - Verify file integrity after migration
   - Ensure proper linkage between records and their attachments

2. **Check File Accessibility**
   - Verify that migrated files can be accessed in REDCap
   - Check that file metadata was preserved
   - Ensure proper permissions for file access

### Calculated Fields

1. **Recalculate After Migration**
   - Allow REDCap to recalculate values after migration
   - Verify that calculations produce expected results
   - Check for any discrepancies between source and calculated values

## Conclusion

Successful REDCap migrations require careful planning, thorough testing, and rigorous validation. By following these best practices, you can ensure that your data maintains its integrity and usability while being securely transferred to your REDCap environment.

Remember that each migration is unique, and you may need to adapt these practices to your specific situation. Documentation and testing are your best tools for ensuring a smooth migration process.
