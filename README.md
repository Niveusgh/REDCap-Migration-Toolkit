# REDCap Data Migration Toolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for securely migrating data from legacy systems to REDCap while maintaining data integrity and compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Overview

This toolkit provides a set of utilities and best practices for handling one of the most challenging aspects of REDCap administration: migrating existing research data from legacy systems into REDCap's data structure. Developed based on real-world migration projects across multiple university research environments, these tools are designed to streamline the migration process while ensuring data integrity and regulatory compliance.

## Features

### Data Mapping Framework
- Flexible templates for mapping source data to REDCap data dictionary structures
- Support for complex data types including calculated fields, checkboxes, and file uploads
- Handling for special characters and encoding issues common in research datasets

### Validation Engine
- Pre-migration validation to identify potential data format issues
- Data type compliance checking against REDCap field restrictions
- Identification of missing required fields before migration begins
- Branching logic validation to ensure conditional dependencies are preserved

### Migration Utilities
- Clean conversion of datetime formats across different systems
- Longitudinal data structure support with proper event mapping
- Repeating instruments data handling
- File attachment migration with proper metadata preservation

### Security & Compliance
- PHI identification and handling in accordance with HIPAA regulations
- Data anonymization options for sensitive datasets
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail requirements
- Encryption handling for secure data transfer

### Reporting
- Migration summary reports with success/error metrics
- Detailed error logs with actionable remediation steps
- Visual data validation dashboards to verify migration accuracy

## Use Cases

This toolkit was developed and refined during data migration projects for research databases at multiple universities, including:

- Migration of 2,000+ participant records from legacy systems
- Conversion of longitudinal assessment data with complex branching logic
- Integration of healthcare referral systems with secure e-consent mechanisms
- Preservation of multi-year research data with 99.7% integrity verification

## Technical Implementation

The toolkit is implemented using Python with the following components:
- REDCap API integration for secure data transfer
- Pandas for efficient data transformation
- Schema validation tools for data dictionary compliance
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Access to source data system
- REDCap API credentials (with appropriate permissions)
- REDCap data dictionary for destination project

### Basic Usage
1. Configure the mapping template for your source data
2. Run pre-migration validation
3. Review and resolve any identified issues
4. Execute migration with appropriate logging level
5. Verify migration with post-migration validation tools
